## What is it for?

## Picture worth a thousand words!

## Features
When you have an undeclared variable in your code and use eslint or jshint linter, you will get a linter error. In this case you can click on the variable (with jshint you have to either put a cursor at the beginning of the variable or just highlight it) and a quick fix actions will appear providing a convenient way to add a missing import statement.
This smart helper can detect whether es6 imports or just plain old require is used in the file based on the existing imports.
Preferable imports type can be set via settings.
If you do not have a linter in your project, you can still make use of this extension by enabling the quickfixes for selection.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `npmSmartImporter.autoDetectImportStatement`: Indicates if smart importer should figure out which import statement to use based on what imports are already present in the file. If none found it will adhere to useES6Import value. Default: true
* `npmSmartImporter.useES6Import`: If true, es6 import statement will be used for new imports. Default: true
* `npmSmartImporter.provideImportSuggestionsOnSelection`: If true, import suggestions will be provided not only for linting errors, but also when a variable is highlighted. It is useful when you do not use linter for some reason, or linting is disabled for undeclared variables. Default: false

## Enjoy!
